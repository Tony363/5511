Extend the Binary Search Tree into an AVL tree, ignore duplicate values during insertion. Provide all of part A in latex and part B in python code. 

## Design

* Add a "height" value in each node to record the height of the local tree with the node as root and allow the parent node to access it when calculating the balance factor.
* Write the "insertion" algorithm, which can call additional algorithms to do rebalancing when needed.
* Provide the time complexity T(n) derived from its recurrence relation into a mathematical expression of all the operations for the AVL Tree with out using BigO notations.
* Provide the latex algorithms for the methods of search, insert, delete, walk and print.

## Programming

  * Implement the AVL tree that extends the BST that has the methods for search, insert, delete, walk and print.
  * Test the correctness of the program in representative sample runs.
