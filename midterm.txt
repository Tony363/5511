given array, and algorithm applied to it, what happens?
algorithm datastructure memory tracing
given algorithm, asked what will happen
analyze performance, what will happen to given dataset
no detailed math proofs
exam similar to theoretical part of hw, no longer explanation
harder part given problem, come up with algorithm to solve
read problem very carefully
May need to come up with  T(n) = O(n), not too picky about mathematical details,
    conceptual correctness
generally give worst best average case

lecture notes and analytical parts of assignments
